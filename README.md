# üõ†Ô∏è S1000D Bug Report

This project demonstrates how real-world bug reports can be converted into modular, structured S1000D technical documentation using XML. Inspired by support issues encountered while working in a clinical systems support role, these simulated Data Modules (DMs) showcase how structured content can enhance clarity, traceability, and maintainability across technical teams.

## üìö Project Goals

- Simulate the structure and flow of Boeing‚Äôs S1000D-based technical publications  
- Convert live production bug reports into reusable XML Data Modules  
- Practice CSDB-like organization using GitHub as a lightweight platform  
- Demonstrate a strong understanding of technical documentation lifecycles and support workflows

## üîß Tools Used

- GitHub for version control and modular storage (mimicking CSDB structure)  
- Custom XML Data Module templates (S1000D-like structure)  
- VS Code + XML Linter for authoring and validation  
- Local static server for simulating IETM viewer compatibility  
- [Issue 6 Errata Reference](https://www.s1000d.org/) for real browser/test environment behaviors

## üìÅ Sample Data Modules

| File                        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tiq-token-refresh.xml`     | Describes a midnight OAuth2 token failure and SignalR race condition        |
| `tiq-moment-deprecation.xml`| Logs unrecognized date formats and breaks in date parsing                   |
| `tiq-ui-hang.xml`           | Details a broken interface flow post-refresh requiring manual reload        |

Each file contains:
- A structured XML layout  
- Fault isolation and symptom description  
- Root cause analysis and remedy steps  
- Optional reference to logs/screenshots in `/screenshots/`

## üß† Why S1000D?

The S1000D XML standard is widely used in aerospace and defense for technical publications. By reformatting support tickets and system incidents into Data Modules, we:
- Improve modularity and reusability  
- Enhance future integration with CSDB and IETP workflows  
- Build technical documentation that aligns with Boeing‚Äôs real-world tooling:  
  `S1000Dmanager`, `authorPro XE`, `publisher`, and `prism viewer`
